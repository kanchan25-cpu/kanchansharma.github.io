## 👋 About Me

I am a research scholar working in the area of **3D Reconstruction**, focusing on geometry-based deep learning, point cloud processing, and mesh editing. 

I completed my **Master’s degree in Mathematics from IIT Kanpur**, where I developed a deep interest in **Reaction–Diffusion equations** and mathematical modeling.

Currently, my research lies at the intersection of:

- 3D Computer Vision   
- Deep Learning for 3D Data   
- Mesh Editing
